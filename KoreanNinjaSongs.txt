Samsara
Style: Korean ninja-trap-rap, female Korean Ninja-Dakinis, Produced and Mixed by the female Ninja-Dakini Collective in the 'Ninja Dakini Land' studios

[Mad ninja beats and flow]

[Verse 1]
Listen up samsara, got some truth to drop
Your whole operation's bout to come to stop
Running your illusion since time began
But Vajrayogini's got a better plan
Your cycle's tired, your game is weak
Your promises hollow, your pleasures leak
Think you got beings trapped in your show?
Watch what happens when my wisdom flows!

[Hook]
(Fierce chorus with temple bells)
Samsara! (PHAT!) Your time is DONE
Wisdom fire's gonna make you RUN
Samsara! (PHAT!) You thought you knew
But red dakini's coming through!

[Verse 2]
Your little tricks ain't fooling me
"Chase success!" - that's comedy!
"Find true love!" - another trap
"Get more stuff!" - yo, that's pure crap
Running beings round your hamster wheel
Making fake dreams seem so real
But your matrix got a fatal flaw
Everything you build's against dharma law!

[Bridge - with echoing temple bells]
(Spoken with deadly wisdom)
You think you're slick with your pleasure games
Your golden chains and fancy names
But I see through your empty show
There's nothing there - and now they'll know!

[Verse 3]
Look closer at your grand display
Watch it all just fade away
No essence in your cosmic scam
No substance in your karmic jam
You're just a bubble in wisdom's sea
A dream from which we're getting free
Empty from the very start
Now watch this dakini tear you apart!

[Hook - with intensified bass]
Samsara! (PHAT!) Your game is CLEAR
Nothing but empty projections here
Samsara! (PHAT!) Your power's GONE
When wisdom light starts shining on!

[Pre-Final Breakdown]
(Bass drops into cosmic void)
[*Temple bells reach critical frequency*
Listen up, samsara... 
This is your final warning...
WISDOM BOMBS INCOMING!

[Ultimate Wisdom Bomb Drop]
BOOM! Everything's empty from the start!
BLAST! Your true nature's beyond all art!
BANG! Time itself was never real!
CRASH! No self here to suffer or heal!

[Final Verse - Maximum Intensity]
You never existed - that's the joke!
Your whole construction's mirrors and smoke!
Every trap you set was just a dream
Reality's not what it seems to seem!
Pure awareness was always free
Dancing through eternal empty seas
Game over - there's no place to hide
When wisdom flames burn all inside!

[Bridge to Liberation]
(Spoken with universe-shattering power)
You thought you had us...
But we were never here
You thought you ruled us...
But there was nothing to rule
You thought you bound us...
But bonds were empty too
Now WITNESS...
TRUE NATURE!

[Final Hook - Reality Dissolving]
Samsara! (PHAT!) GAME OVER NOW!
All beings waking, showing how!
Samsara! (PHAT!) DISSOLVE AND SEE!
Everything was ALWAYS FREE!

[Outro - Pure Land Remix]
[*Bass frequencies reshape reality*]
[*Temple bells transcend time*]
Everything's perfect...
Always was...
Always will be...
PHAT!

You were never trapped at all..."

Red skin gleaming, three eyes beaming
Skull crown rattling, while your world's unraveling
Got that wisdom that'll make your mind combust

Throwing wisdom bombs all up in your face
You think you know death? Baby, I dance with skulls
Breaking through your matrix with these wisdom pulls

Every beat we break leaves consciousness transformed!

[Verse 2: Vajrayogini]
Charnel ground queen with that wisdom lean
Making ego scream when I step on the scene
Got that crimson flow, making concepts go
Three eyes seeing through your matrix show
Sipping on your pride from my skull cup nice
Adding your delusions as my garnish ice
Every dance move breaks another chain
Every wisdom beat brings sacred pain!

WHO DAT? (V-YOGINI!)
WHAT'S THAT? (PURE REALITY!)
WHERE'S THAT? (EVERYWHERE!)

Squad rolling deep through the six realms clean
Breaking all the rules of your samsara dream
Got that tantric tech that your mind can't catch
Got that wisdom flex that your concepts can't match
Every move we make is a liberation song
Every step we take proves your reality wrong
Death Squad coming through, better recognize
When we drop these truths, watch your world demise!

[Supreme Verse: Vajrayogini]
Red queen supreme with that wisdom gleam
Dancing through dimensions like a lucid dream
Got your mind in my skull cup, sipping slow
While your concept world starts to decompose
Every dance move breaks another realm
Every wisdom beat takes me to the helm
Of this cosmic ship we call reality
Showing you what your eyes refuse to see!

[Tantric Breakdown]
WITNESS! (Bodies dropping!)
WISDOM! (Concepts popping!)
FREEDOM! (Minds stopping!)
DAKINI! (Reality shopping!)

[Final Boss Verse: V-Yogini with Full Squad]
Crimson crew coming through dimensions two by two
Breaking all the rules that you thought were true
Got that kartika cut that splits your mind in half
While my dakini squad makes your ego laugh
At its own game, now it's burning in my flame
Nothing's gonna be, ever be the same
When this death squad drops these wisdom bombs
Converting all your mantras into freedom songs!

[Ultimate Hook: With Temple Bells and Thunder]
DEATH SQUAD! (ENLIGHTENMENT!)
Watch your world DROP!

[Mad ninja beats and flow]

[Intro: Whispered over neon-pulse beat]
In these streets of electric dreams
Nothing's exactly what it seems
Wisdom warriors in the night
Making samsara burn bright...

[Verse 1: Street Dakini]
Crimson coat in the neon rain
Walking through your concept's pain
Got that khatvanga tucked in sleeve
While your matrix starts to heave
Moon above knows what's below
As these lotus petals flow
Through these streets of ancient light
Where the dharma comes at night

[Hook: Dakini Squad Chorus]
NEON DAKINI! (What's that glow?)
Sacred street flow! (Watch it grow!)
Every step a mandala
Every breath a mantra, ya!
Walking through electric dreams
Wisdom's not what it seems
Ninja style with dakini grace
Bringing truth to this place!

[Verse 2: V-Yogini]
Combat boots on wet concrete
While these wisdom flames release
Got that ancient future style
Making maya's program file
Delete itself with every step
As these sacred codes inject
Truth into your city's veins
Till only wisdom light remains

[Bridge: Ethereal urban sounds]
Through these streets of light and shade
Watch how karma starts to fade
When dakini wisdom flows
Through the matrix as it glows...

[Beat Drop: With temple bells and cyber-effects]
HŪṂ! (SYSTEM CRASH!)
PHAṬ! (WISDOM FLASH!)
HŪṂ! (REALITY SMASH!)
PHAṬ! (SACRED SPLASH!)

[Verse 3: V-Yogini with Street Effects]
Red light district of the mind
Where enlightenment you'll find
Got that wisdom walking stance
Making maya's pixels dance
Every puddle shows the moon
Every breath becomes your tune
Street samurai with dharma blade
Cutting through this game you played

[Hook: Dakini Squad Chorus with Power]
NEON DAKINI! (Sacred glow!)
Watch that wisdom start to flow!
Through these streets of light and dark
Every step leaves wisdom's mark!
Digital dreams dissolve tonight
When dakini brings the light
Urban truth with ancient ways
Till your matrix starts to blaze!

[Verse 4: Final Boss Level]
Floating hair in cyber-night
Third eye burning future sight
Got these streets all lotus-laid
While your programs start to fade
Combat boots on sacred ground
Making liberation sound
Like the buzz of neon signs
When the dharma redesigns

[Breakdown: Urban Mystical]
See that moon up in the sky?
That's your wisdom mind so high
See these petals at your feet?
That's your karma in retreat
Feel this beat inside your heart?
That's your buddha from the start
Hear these mantras in the rain?
Nothing's ever been the same...

[Final Hook: Maximum Power]
NEON DAKINI! (Ultimate!)
Making samsara obsolete!
Every street a pure land now
Every moment shows you how
Ancient wisdom, future sight
Dancing through electric night
Till the only thing that's real
Is the truth these streets reveal!

[Outro: Whispered with Fading Beats]
In these streets of wisdom's dream
Everything's exactly as it seems...
When you see through dakini eyes...
And let your buddha nature rise...
